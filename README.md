# Business and Product Analytics

This repository focuses on **user behavior and product analytics** case studies that examine how users interact with systems and where they drop off. Rather than optimizing isolated metrics, these projects aim to understand **behavioral friction, intent gaps, and decision bottlenecks** in real products.

## Case Study Areas

Analyzing why users fail to progress through critical steps in product journeys.

- **Why Most Users Never Add to Cart**  
  Investigates user funnel data to identify behavioral and structural reasons
  behind add-to-cart drop-offs.

## Why This Repository Exists

Many product decisions rely on surface-level metrics without understanding *why* users behave the way they do.

These case studies focus on:
- interpreting funnels instead of just measuring them
- linking user behavior to product design decisions
- identifying actionable insights, not just patterns
